# Bootstrap Practice Website

This is a simple website project I created to learn and practice **Bootstrap** — while listening to music and longing for her.

## ✨ Features
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap
- Sections for showcasing projects
- Contact form

## 🛠️ Still in Progress
- [ ] Menu button doesn’t toggle back properly on smaller screens
- [ ] Project links are still empty (need to add actual URLs)
- [ ] Contact form not yet connected to an email sender
